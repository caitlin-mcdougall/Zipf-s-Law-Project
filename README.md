# Zipfs-Law-Project
This program scrapes randomly selected Wikipedia pages (obtained using the Wikipedia API) and creates a word-frequency-distribution (WFD) for each page. The program then merges these WFDs and outputs the overall WFD as well as using third party libraries to visualize these results in the form of a graph which shows the Zipfâ€™s Law trend.
